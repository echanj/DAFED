Description:

 note- you need a python 2.7 environment to run these 
 Cute benchmark implementations of the driven adiabatic free
 energy dynamics (AFED) and just adiabatic free energy dynamics (AFED) 
 on 2D- double well potential using a Langevin thermostat.
 
 adapted from some other AFED code for the classical Harmonic Occilator

 the DAFED code scheme should be correct but its not clear if AFED is working correctly
 since it is more difficult to implement.

 hoping that someone can check my work.

 thanks in advance 

 you just have to run the scipts using a python 2.7  env with numpy and matplotlib 
 it should print out some graphs
